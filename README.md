# lawndart-mode - An Emacs major-mode for Dart that works better.

I found some issues with dart-mode, and the codebase appears a bit
unmaintained, so I've started this mode.

# Features in lawndart-mode that are not in dart-mode

- Flycheck integration via dartanalyzer
- Better fontification of types / variables etc.
- Proper indentation for the mode that actually matches dartfmt output.
